GET :  method of is used to fetch the data form the fastapi sever 
       not used to modify the data 
        mainly used to retrive the data ;;;
 
 use : : @app.get("/")
            def function():
                return 




## 
mnaully created on list of dict in python and now we have to return it to the frontend 
using the APIs; (mockdata.python)

use : 
from mockdata import products  === > here the mockdata is python file and there i have sotred the list of products which is the list of dict ;
@app.get("/products")

def products_list():
    return products



dynamic query if we pass the id or count then it will return that perticuler key value pair 
basicly the info it will return  (THIS IS CALLED path PARAM)
WE ARE SEND THE PARAMERTERS FORM TEH URL THAT IS QUERY TO THE BACK AND THEN FETCH ACCORIND TO IT 



@app.get("/products/{count}")
def product_detail(count: int):
    for i in products:
        if i["count"] == count:
            return i
    return {"error": "Product not found"}    


here we collect the count varible form teh url of use and then pass it thorught the if (condition){
    if that perticluler count is present in our key value pair then it will reutnr the key value pair to the 
    webpage 8*** 
}



LET'S NOW SEE THE  query param 

localhost:800/greeting?name=pruthvi


@app.get("/greet")
def greet(name:str,age:int):
    return {"message":f"hello, {name}! you are {age} years old."}

    we can give also the mulitple param also using the ?name=pruthvi & age = 10 
    in url then it's considered as the multiple param pass thorught url 


when the you have fixed number of param then use query parametrs like this 
greet/{variable1}/{variable2} 
so here we have to pass them two varilbe max and mainly

but when it comes to query param we can pass any number of them witout any problem 
def greet(name:str,age:int):


now it's okey for using for two varilbe three varilbe but when it comes to the large number of variables 
then there is coept comes that thats called requst 

REQuest
form fastapi import Request 

@app.get("/greeting/")
def greet(request:Request):
return "something"


@app.get("/greet")
def greet(req:Request):
    return {"message":f"hello , {req.query_params['name']}! you are {req.query_params['age']} years old."}

we can create the req object by using the Request
and then use can use the varible name that pass the query to and then primt them 


let's learng Http methods in fastapi

GET ,PUT , Post , delete


1.GET
in this the clint is used to ask the server and server responese to that request 
that is the GET request how it works 
1.  client == > server  first the client ask the info and then the server resonedd to the client 
1.2 client <== server 

to get something from server 

2.POST 
here we send teh data throught clinet 
and the server is used to store the data in database so 
server also have one conenction between the database 
also the server is also reutrn the one confirmation response to the client 


3.put 
 this method put methdo is used when we have to update the data of server,database 
 
 here we send the (data,data_id) which data will be updated taht have data_id   

 4. delete

 cleint says i want to dleete teh data and send use the dataid 

 (Delete , data_id)

 this is CRUD all this 4 , all the applcaiton are workingon the crud methods
